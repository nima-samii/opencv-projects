# OpenCV Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic OpenCV projects demonstrating various image processing and computer vision techniques.

## Projects

* **Face Detection:**  Detects faces in images using a Haar cascade classifier.  See the `face-detection` directory for more details.
* **Face Recognition:**  Tracks objects in video streams using [mention the tracking method].  See the `face-recognition` directory.
