# Face Detection with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for detecting faces in an image using OpenCV.  It utilizes a Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

## Description

The `face_detection.py` script (or whatever you name your script) reads an image, converts it to grayscale, and then uses a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier to detect faces within the image.  It draws bounding boxes around the detected faces and displays the original image with the bounding boxes, as well as the grayscale version of the image.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
